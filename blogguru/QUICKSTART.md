# BlogGuru Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Verify Installation

BlogGuru is already installed in your repository. Check that these files exist:
```bash

# Should show: README.md, config.yml, run.py, core/, etc.
```

### Step 2: Set Your OpenAI API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

Or add to your `~/.blogguru-env` file:
```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"' >> ~/.blogguru-env
source ~/.blogguru-env
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Products

Edit `blogguru/config.yml`:

#### For ClickBank Products (Manual Link Collection):
1. Go to ClickBank Marketplace
2. Find your product
3. Click "Promote" and copy the encrypted affiliate link
4. Add it to your product configuration:

```yaml
# Update your ClickBank nickname

  clickbank:
    nickname: fuelaura  # Your actual ClickBank nickname

# Add your products with manual affiliate links
products:
  - name: "Your Product Name"
    platform: clickbank
    product_id: "your-product-id"
    landing_page: "https://product-landing-page.com"  # Important!
    affiliate_link: "https://your-manually-copied-affiliate-link.com"  # Use this instead of hoplink
    category: health
    keywords:
      - keyword1
      - keyword2
```

#### For Other Platforms or Legacy ClickBank Setup:
```yaml

  - name: "Your Product Name"

```yaml
products:
  - name: "Product Name"
    enabled: true  # Add this if missing
