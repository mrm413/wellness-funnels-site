# Wellness Funnels Site - GitHub Actions Investigation

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Clone repository
- [x] Examine repository structure
- [x] Check GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- [x] Review recent workflow runs
- [x] Identify root cause of queued/cancelled runs
- [x] Check self-hosted runner status - NO RUNNERS CONNECTED
- [x] Examine workflow configuration issues

## Issue Identification
- [x] ROOT CAUSE: No self-hosted runner connected to repository
- [x] Workflow requires Windows runner with Ollama installed
- [x] All runs stuck in queued status waiting for non-existent runner
- [x] Need to either: setup self-hosted runner OR migrate to GitHub-hosted runners

## Solution Options Analysis
- [x] Confirmed GitHub Pages deployment works (automatic)
- [x] Only BlogGuru autopilot workflow is failing
- [x] Analyzed BlogGuru components and requirements
- [x] Created comprehensive Digital Ocean setup guide

## Digital Ocean Setup Documentation
- [x] Document what BlogGuru does
- [x] List system requirements
- [x] Provide installation instructions
- [x] Create automation scripts (cron + systemd)
- [x] Add monitoring and troubleshooting guide
- [x] Include cost estimates

## Implementation: Migrate to OpenAI API
- [x] User has OpenAI API key
- [x] Created blogbot_openai.py with OpenAI integration
- [x] Created new workflow blogguru-openai.yml (ubuntu-latest)
- [x] Updated config.yml with OpenAI model settings
- [x] Created setup instructions for user
- [ ] Create new branch and push changes
- [ ] Create pull request with all updates
- [ ] User adds OPENAI_API_KEY secret to GitHub
- [ ] User merges PR and tests workflow
